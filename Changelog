	- Fixed bug where directories containing multiple subdirectories
	  would not write more than one dir due to a problem with linked
	  lists. (Fixed by Andrew Nile)
	
	- Fixed bug where data sections received before the root gateway
	  object was received would not be added to their file's metadata.
	  This was due to a problem with recursing through the directory
	  structure at the time the data arrives. (Fixed by Andrew Nile)

	- Add MinGW compatibility.

	- Minor memory fixes.
